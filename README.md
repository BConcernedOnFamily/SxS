# SxS
It is the sxs directory that solved the problem that Windows server 2012 cannot install the .net Framework 3.5.
So I upload the directory named sxs, which comes from Microsoft's official website(https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2012).
And I download the .iso, but My OS is Datacenter, and it's ok to solve my proble. 
Pleace see the web page（https://www.jianshu.com/p/d27c61f7d439） if you want to see Specific installation process.
